# COI Random Turn Generator

This random turns generator for Cheeze Wizards duels uses proper uniform distribution for fractional math and rounding which makes it more accurately "random" than other random number generators you will find online.

# Requirements

Node.js + NPM, see: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

# Installation
```
$ npm install
```

# Usage

From console:
```
$ npm start
> Turn 1: FIRE
> Turn 2: WATER
> Turn 3: WATER
> Turn 4: WATER
> Turn 5: WIND
```

# Notes
I've also included `index.js` as an exportable model in case anyone wishes to build a UI for this generator.
